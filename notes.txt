Data Change with Mutation

var player = {score: 1, name: 'Jeff'};
player.score = 2;
Now player is {score: 2, name: 'Jeff'}


Data Change without Mutation

var player = {score: 1, name: 'Jeff'};

var newPlayer = Object.assign({}, player, {score: 2});
Now player is unchanged, but newPlayer is {score: 2, name: 'Jeff'}
Or if you're using object spread syntax proposal, you can write:
var newPlayer = {...player, score: 2};
